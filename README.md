# Project Title

Scan .doc .pdf and .docx for keywords

## Getting Started

You will need a directory with the following folder structure

../Input
../Continue
../Disregard

### Prerequisites

This should work without installing anything additional
It may be easier to create a shortcut of the resume_runner.exe (taking the exe out of the build file will break the program)
